# File References For Your Project

This folder is for **you** to add any files that Claude should use as reference when building your project.

## What to Put Here

Place any files that will help Claude understand what you want:

### Examples of Useful Files

- **Sample files to mimic**: "Build something like this example.pdf"
- **Documentation**: API docs, specs, design documents
- **Data files**: CSVs, JSONs, or other data to process
- **Screenshots**: Images of desired layouts or designs
- **Code snippets**: Example code you want to replicate
- **Templates**: Forms, emails, or document templates to use

## How Claude Uses These Files

When you run your project:
1. Claude automatically checks this folder
2. Reads any files you've placed here
3. Uses them as context and examples
4. References them when building your project

## Tips

- **Use descriptive filenames**: `example_api_response.json` is better than `file1.json`
- **Add a note**: Create a file called `NOTES.md` here to explain what each file is for
- **Organize with subfolders**: Feel free to create subfolders like `examples/`, `docs/`, `data/`

## This Folder is Optional

If you don't have reference files, that's fine! Just provide a detailed description in `START_HERE.md` and Claude will work from that.
